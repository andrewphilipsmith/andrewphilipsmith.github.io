# About Me

I am a [Senior Research Data Scientist](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/andy-smith) at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). Previously, I was an early member of the team in [MapAction](https://mapaction.org/). Occasionally, I dabble in [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/AnotherSmith/history#map=8/53.321/-0.882), but not as frequently as I would like.

# Mini CV

I have worked with geospatial data for 25 years in many different ways:

* **Conventionally** - I started my career with Desktop GIS and commercial geospatial SDKs
* **Scientifically** - I scientifically tested available data in depth during my PhD, developing new methods where existing tools did not suffice.
* **Rapidly** - Working in multiple crisis responses, I learnt to work quickly and effectively, knowing when good enough is good enough.
* **As a Manager** – I’ve covered team and project management, licensing, budgets, privacy, policy, risk management, vendor selection and tendering.
* **As a Software Engineer** – I have developed data management and processing pipelines.
* **Analytically** – My current role requires statistically sound and reproducible analysis of available data.
* **As an enabler** - I have run IT infrastructure to support others working with geospatial.
* **As a mentor** – I was the principal mentor for a [Google Summer of Code project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6021028314087424)

# Selected highlights

A very subjective list of software development project which I've particularly enjoyed:

## MapReader

* [Code](https://github.com/maps-as-data/MapReader)
* [Docs](https://mapreader.readthedocs.io/)
* [JOSS Paper](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.06434) 

MapReader is a python-based computer vision tool for exploring historical maps. My focus was to guide MapReader in the transition from bespoke software for a specific research project, through to its launch as a generic standalone research tool. I co-presented on the software at the Sorbonne Center for Artificial Intelligence Summer School , and was one of the named recipients of the Roy Rosenzweig Prize for Innovation in Digital History , awarded to MapReader.

## A/B Street

* [Code](https://github.com/a-b-street/abstreet) 
* [Docs](https://a-b-street.github.io/docs/index.html)

A/B Street is a group of Rust-based applications for modelling local street traffic primarily developed by Dustin Carlino. It focuses on how proposed changes to street layouts will impact pedestrians and cyclists. Following its real-world use in public consultations, I implemented interface changes that had been requested by end users.

## Popgetter

* [Code - Upstream pipeline](https://github.com/Urban-Analytics-Technology-Platform/poppusher)
* [Code - Client core](https://github.com/Urban-Analytics-Technology-Platform/popgetter)
* [Code - Browser](https://github.com/Urban-Analytics-Technology-Platform/popgetter-browser)
* [Docs](https://popgetter.readthedocs.io) 

Popgetter is a toolset built from scratch to simplify programmatic access to census data, across multiple geographies, implemented using Rust and Python. I contributed to the overall design, ensuring that end-user installed components have minimal dependencies, whilst the upstream data processing pipeline uses a well-established framework to ease maintenance and support. I was also the principal contributor to the upstream pipeline.

## MapAction's Map and Data Repository

* [The repository](https://maps.mapaction.org)
* [Case study](https://aptivate.org/en/work/projects/mapaction)
* [Code - Commissioned CKAN extensions](https://github.com/orgs/aptivate/repositories?type=all&q=ckan+fork%3Afalse)

A past project I remain proud of is the introduction of MapAction’s Map and Data Repository, which sought to change the way the organisation treated and published geospatial data. Whilst I was Technical Director at MapAction, I successfully led the largest single project undertaken by the organisation at the time. This involved collaborating transparently with multiple internal and external stakeholders to tease out the user needs and priorities.

Throughout the project, I drove the adoption of open-source software, both with the selection of the open-source CKAN platform and by introducing a policy to publish code developed by the project using permissive licenses. Through this we commissioned several open-source CKAN extensions, some of which continue to be used by the wider CKAN community.
