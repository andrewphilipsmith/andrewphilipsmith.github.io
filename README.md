# About Me

I am a [Senior Research Data Scientist](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/andy-smith) at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). Some of the projects I've enjoyed contributing to include:

* [MapReader](https://github.com/maps-as-data/MapReader) - A computer vision pipeline for analysing historical maps at scale.
* [Popgetter](https://popgetter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - A collection of tools for extracting population data from censuses across several countries.
* [A/B Street](https://github.com/a-b-street/abstreet) - A traffic simulation and analysis tool for active travel.

Previously, I was an early member of the team in [MapAction](https://mapaction.org/). I joined as a volunteer in 2024, a few months before the Asian Tsunami. Over 17 years, I held various roles encompassing everything from fixing the printers to leading teams in post-disaster environments, to serving as part of the management team as Technical Director.

Occasionally, I dabble in [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/AnotherSmith/history#map=8/53.321/-0.882), but not as frequently as I would like.
